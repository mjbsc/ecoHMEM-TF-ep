# ecoHMEM-TensorFlow

This repo contains Deep Neural Network use cases based on TensorFlow and the configuration files to execute them with the ecoHMEM framework. You will need recent versions of Extrae, Flexmalloc and ecoHMEM because several issues have been fixed, both for correctness and performance, while performing experiments with these use cases.
